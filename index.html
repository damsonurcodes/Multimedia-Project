<h2>Nine months since the British people voted to leave the European Union (EU), researchers are still in the dark about the future of research grants in this country, stalling development plans post-2020. Now the Government needs a concrete plan to replace EU grants fast – before it loses its place as Europe’s premier research superpower. </h2>

<p>For the past two years, Professor Vik Dhillon, of the University of Sheffield&rsquo;s Physics and Astronomy program, has been working on a massive undertaking in astronomy research. &nbsp;</p>
<p>His life has been on the go as he works on the HiPERCAM, a specially designed camera researching the rapid variability of deep space. As head of the program, he coordinates with a myriad of scientists in Europe and the United States of America, all the while conceptualising the camera itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been a typical day in my work,&rdquo; he says, in his temporary lab in La Palma, Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taking years to build, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to using it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project, a 3.5 million Euro endeavour, would finish in 2019, the exact date of the Government&rsquo;s formal exit from the EU &ndash; and it may be the last research project of its kind.</p>

  <p> <strong> The situation </strong> <p>
  <p>Currently, the Government has promised a two-billion-pound investment by 2020, enough to cover a funding gap that would be left in the case that ERC grant access will no longer be possible. However, the question of where this money will go is another matter entirely &ndash; and has been left unanswered by the Government at this time.</p>
  <p>Large scale research projects like Professor Dhillon&rsquo;s are planned years in advance, and the Government&rsquo;s lack of a concrete plan after the exit is stalling future research plans post-2019, especially as European researchers continue to look for collaborative links ahead of any future projects they may have.</p>
  <p>The ERC&rsquo;s Horizon2020 contribution is miniscule in comparison to the &pound;200 billion pounds of the UK&rsquo;s total expenditure in Research and Development (R&amp;D). However, looking into the microcosm of competitive research grants in universities, the impact of losing such grants would be like losing one whole Research Council. Compounded by the Government&rsquo;s past Thatcherite stance of bureaucratic, business-first research endeavours, losing the inherent flexibility in getting these grants would slow down research considerably in this area.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There simply aren't any ERC-like grants available from [domestic research councils like] the STFC (Science Technology and Facilities Council),&rdquo; Professor Dhillon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ERC funds high-risk but high pay-off research projects, and provides very substantial amounts of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The STFC is much more strategy driven and generally does not provide grants of such high value to individuals,&rdquo; Professor Dhillon said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of this that EU grants disproportionally attract more university researchers than businesses, and it would be these same institutions that would be dealt the brunt of the economic blow from the sudden disappearance of a flexible fund like the ERC grants.</p>
<p>According to Digital Science, research universities like Cambridge and Oxford get 20% of their funding from ERC programmes, and lesser intensive research institutions like the University of Greenwich, or the University of Wolverhampton, would be hit harder, as each gets over 60% of their research funding from the EU.</p>

   <figcaption> What is the UKRI really? </figcaption>
 </figure>
    <p> <strong> A domestic solution? </strong> <p>
    <p>Right now, the UK is in the process of creating a domestic, ERC-like replacement called the United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI), combining the authority of all seven UK research councils and Research UK and Innovate UK into one organisation. Currently, the bill outlining powers of the organisation are being amended by the House of Lords, and will most likely come through.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that the formation of UKRI will provide indispensable support to our research and innovation leadership during this period of change in our relationship with the European Union,&rdquo; said Minister of Universities and Science, Jo Johnston MP, in a speech made in the Wellcome Trust last year about the organisation.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Now, more than ever, as these communities face new challenges, we need a strong and unified voice to represent your interests across government, across Europe and around the world,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>However, the bill makes no mention of the grant schemes that the UKRI will control. While discussions of vague priority areas are one of few details that have surfaced, it&rsquo;s still unstable ground to mount long-term high-risk scientific research in the UK post-2020.</p>
    <p>Looking into the bill further yielded no extra information, and as it stands, the creation of the UKRI seems little more than a band-aid measure rather than a definite alternative to the ERC. </p>
    <figure class= "floatquoteright">
    <p> &ldquo;I think things will be worse for scientists like myself.&rdquo;</p>
    </figure>
    <p> <strong> Worst case scenario </strong> </p>
    <p>Currently, uncertainty about the UK&rsquo;s research schemes is bleeding into worries that the country will become less attractive to scientific talent. In the worst-case scenario, there is talk of this talent moving out of the UK to maintain links to ERC grants.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Personally, I won&rsquo;t do this due to family reasons. But I could imagine why other people might, particularly those earlier in their careers,&rdquo; Professor Dhillon said.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But, in the future, I think things will be worse for scientists like myself.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;There might well be funding available from the Government post-Brexit in certain priority areas, but if you are not working in such an area, then I think funding will be harder to obtain in the future.&rdquo; Professor Dhillon said.</p>
